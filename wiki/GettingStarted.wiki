= Getting started =

If you start jeboorker the first time, you have to specify the folder where youre ebooks located at. This can be done with the menu _File->Read folder_. You can add as many folders as you want. 

After the read process has been done, all books from all folders you've specified appears in the main area. 

Always you've changed something within your ebook collection, you should perform a _File->Refresh folder_ for a rescan, so jeboorker can recognize these changes.
