Always you copy some new ebooks with your favourite file manager to your collection, just perfrom a _File->Refresh folder_ for a rescan, so jeboorker can recognize these.

The folders you've added can be toggled in it's visibility state by _File->Show/hide folder_.

= Adding new books using Drag and Drop =
You can copy Books simply by Dragging it in the Jeboorker list. The book is copied to the same folder as the drop target book is
located. You can also drag a book from Jeboorker to you favourite file manager.

= Search books using the filters =
Jeboorker provides a filter field at the bottom which allows to filter for keywords. Separating keywords by comma cause 
a filter for each of the separated keywords. You can specify which kind of data should be searched by checking the desired kinds at the filter combobox at the left of
the filter text field. If no filter is selected the filter is performed to title, author and file name. 

Another way to filter is to use the filter tree at the left. Each base path registered with Jeboorker can be found in that
tree. You can click at the eyeballs to toggle the visibility of each base path. Always you select a base path or a folder
