/**
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Since version 2.1 this class delegates ALL calls to a static instance of the new MimeUtil2 implementation.
 * @see eu.medsea.mimeutil.MimeUtil2
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>MimeUtil</code> utility is a utility class that allows applications to detect, work with and manipulate MIME types.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A MIME or "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension" type is an Internet standard that is important outside of just e-mail use.
 * MIME is used extensively in other communications protocols such as HTTP for web communications.
 * IANA "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" is responsible for the standardisation and publication of MIME types. Basically any
 * resource on any computer that can be located via a URI can be assigned a mime type. So for instance, JPEG images have a MIME type
 * of image/jpg. Some resources can have multiple MIME types associated with them such as files with an XML extension have the MIME types
 * text/xml and application/xml and even specialised versions of xml such as image/svg+xml for SVG image files.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To do this <code>MimeUtil</code> uses registered <code>MimeDetector</code>(s) that are delegated to in sequence to actually
 * perform the detection. There a several <code>MimeDetector</code> implementations that come with the utility and
 * you can register and unregister them to perform detection based on file extensions, file globing and magic number detection.<br/>
 * Their is also a fourth MimeDetector that is registered by default that detects text files and encodings. Unlike the other
 * MimeDetector(s) or any MimeDetector(s) you may choose to implement, the TextMimeDetector cannot be registered or
 * unregistered by your code. It is advisable that you read the java doc for the TextMimeDetector as it can be modified in
 * several ways to make it perform better and or detect more specific types.<br/>
 *
 * Please refer to the java doc for each of these <code>MimeDetector</code>(s) for a description of how they
 * actually perform their particular detection process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that MIME matching is not an exact science, meaning
 * that a positive match does not guarantee that the returned MIME type is actually correct.
 * It is a best guess method of matching and the matched MIME types should be used with this in
 * mind.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * New <code>MimeDetector</code>(s) can easily be created and registered with <code>MimeUtil</code> to extend it's
 * functionality beyond these initial detection strategies by extending the <code>AbstractMimeDetector</code> class.
 * To see how to implement your own <code>MimeDetector</code> take a look
 * at the java doc and source code for the {@link ExtensionMimeDetector}, {@link MagicMimeMimeDetector} and
 * {@link OpendesktopMimeDetector} classes. To register and unregister MimeDetector(s) use the
 * [un]registerMimeDetector(...) methods of this class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The order that the <code>MimeDetector</code>(s) are executed is defined by the order each <code>MimeDetector</code> is registered.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The resulting <code>Collection</code> of MIME types returned in response to a getMimeTypes(...) call is a normalised list of the
 * accumulation of MIME types returned by each of the registered <code>MimeDetector</code>(s) that implement the specified getMimeTypesXXX(...)
 * methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All methods in this class that return a Collection object containing MimeType(s) actually return a {@link MimeTypeHashSet}
 * that implements both the {@link Set} and {@link Collection} interfaces.
 * </p>
